# discord-listening-along-exploit
Spams your discord/spotify listening along with tokens, not really an exploit, can be implemented into raiders. Fun way to confuse and/or annoy friends.

# How to use?
Load otpbot.txt with your tokens, then go to main.py and open it in a text editor of your choice.

Go to the top and edit these 2.

1st = Your UserID, or a UserID that is currently playing a song.

2nd = Burner server invite, or not idk.


Then start listening to a song on spotify and run main.py.

Easy enough?
